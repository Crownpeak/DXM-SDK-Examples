# Crownpeak Digital Experience Management (DXM) Software Development Kit (SDK) Examples
Crownpeak Digital Experience Management (DXM) Software Development Kits (SDK) have been constructed to assist
the Single Page App developer in developing client-side applications that leverage DXM for content management purposes.

## Installation
1) Clone this repository to your local development environment;
2) Install the necessary Node Modules (e.g., ```yarn install```), then start the application (i.e., ```yarn start```);
3) Run <a href="https://github.com/Crownpeak/Content-Xcelerator" target="_blank">Crownpeak Content Xcelerator℠</a> on
the manifest located within the "Crownpeak-Content-Xcelerator℠" folder in the root of the example - this will setup the SiteRoot and Project inside DXM
4) Create your .env file containing the detail for your CMS Instance (see one of the SDK README pages (above) for more detail);
5) Begin developing and scaffold when you want to apply changes to DXM (i.e., ```yarn crownpeak scaffold```).
